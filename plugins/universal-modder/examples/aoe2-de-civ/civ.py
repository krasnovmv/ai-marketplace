"""The San Franciscans, as data: edit this file (and the art in assets/gen) to make your own civ.

build_mod.py turns it into a data mod; make_sprites.py / make_wonder.py make the sprites it names
(frame counts and sprite names are shared by both sides, so they can't drift apart); make_scenario.py
builds a demo map with it.

Ids of stock objects (units, techs, buildings, graphics) are the game's own: look them up with
genieutils (`DatFile.parse(".../empires2_x2_p1.dat").civs[1].units[38].name` -> 'KNGHT') or with
Advanced Genie Editor. New string ids must be unused in the stock string tables. A unit or tech with
string id N uses N (name), N + 1000 ("Create ..." / "Research ..."), N + 100000 (help) and N + 150000
(hotkey / tech-tree text), the stock pattern.

# The civ takes over the Burgundians' slot. A genuinely extra (64th) civ loads and plays, but the
# game's civ picker only lists civs the executable knows: its civ-id table (BRITON-CIV ... DANES-CIV)
# and the UI icon tables are index-based and hard-coded (index 63 is "random"). Replacing a slot is
# how DE civ mods ship; the Burgundians come back when the mod is removed.

# Civ bonuses: effect commands appended to the civ's tech-tree effect (applied at game start), each with
# its line in the description. (5, unit, class, attribute, x) multiplies an attribute of a unit (-1: any)

# Units. The first is the unique unit (trained at the Castle from the Castle Age, with an Elite
# upgrade); the others are extra units made available in their `age`. Each is a copy of a stock
# `template` unit (its class, sounds, attack/armour classes and the settings of its graphics records)
# with the stats given here and new sprites.
#   cost:  (resource, amount), resources 0 food, 1 wood, 2 stone, 3 gold
#   train: building (82 Castle, 87 Archery Range, 101 Stable, 12 Barracks), time (s), button slot, hotkey
#   bonus_attacks: extra (armour class, amount): 20 siege, 21 buildings
#   icons: menus, the civ picker and the tech tree load our art (menu_art -> uniticons/<menu_icon>_50730.png).
#          The in-game command panel draws icons from the base game's prebuilt widgetui atlas, which a
#          local mod can't extend (tested: widgetui/ in the mod root and under resources/_common are both
#          ignored), so in-game the units borrow the closest stock icons (panel_icon): a wheeled
#          battering vehicle (73, Siege Ram) and a war machine (80, Scorpion).
#   anims: frames per angle (16 angles each) and seconds per frame. The rest is for make_sprites.py:
#          a `um render3d` motion plus the tuned parameters the shipped sprites used on top of it
#          (amp/pitch/dist/roll/sink in px or degrees, hover = px above the ground), and burn = darken
#          into a burnt-out wreck.
