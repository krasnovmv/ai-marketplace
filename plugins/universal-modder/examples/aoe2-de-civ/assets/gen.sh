# The San Franciscans' fal art, regenerated with the repo's CLI (needs FAL_KEY). The files in gen/ are
# the ones the mod shipped with; a rerun makes new, different art (and costs fal credits).
#
#   assets/gen.sh concepts     # unit concept art (FLUX.1 [dev]), only the input to image-to-3D
#   assets/gen.sh meshes       # concept -> textured GLB (Trellis 2)
#   assets/gen.sh images       # 2D art: wonder, emblem, unit portraits
#   assets/gen.sh all
#
# Units are rendered from 3D so every one of AoE2's 16 facing angles is consistent; the concept
# images are only the input to image-to-3D. Accents meant to take the player's colour are asked for
# in saturated blue and masked by hue when the sprites are packed (make_sprites.py).
#
# The shipped art came from fal-ai/flux/dev (40 steps, guidance 4; it returns JPEGs) and fal-ai/trellis
# (texture_size 2048, mesh_simplify 0.9). `um fal run` repeats those FLUX calls exactly (`um fal image`
# targets a newer default model). The meshes now use the newer Trellis 2; the original call was
#   um fal run fal-ai/trellis image_url=@gen/robotaxi_concept.jpg texture_size:=2048 mesh_simplify:=0.9 --out gen --name robotaxi
# A new mesh may face another way or have other proportions: check the preview sheet after
# `make_sprites.py all <unit>` and adjust render.forward_yaw / length in civ.py.
